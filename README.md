This a Streamlit web application for comparing and mapping data between modernized and legacy tables in Snowflake. It uses AI models to analyze the data and generate mappings, with options for incorporating vector embeddings and sample data. The app allows users to input table information, select AI models and parameters, and view the generated prompts and AI responses.

To compare the data at the field level between Modernised and Legacy tables and provide a mapping between them, we'll follow a structured approach. This involves analyzing the vector embeddings to identify matching fields, highlighting discrepancies, and suggesting corrections. We'll also provide Snowflake SQL queries to transform the Modernised data to align with the Legacy format where necessary.
